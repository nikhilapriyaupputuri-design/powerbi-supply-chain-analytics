End-to-end Power BI dashboard for supply chain delivery, demand, and location analysis
# End-to-End Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end **Power BI dashboard** designed to analyze supply chain performance across **delivery reliability, demand patterns, and geographic root causes**.

The dashboard is built to support **executive and operational decision-making** by transforming raw supply chain data into actionable insights using **Power Query and DAX**.

---

## 🎯 Business Objectives
The dashboard aims to answer key supply chain questions such as:
- Are deliveries meeting service-level expectations?
- Where and when do delivery delays occur?
- Which products and categories drive the highest demand?
- Are delays concentrated in specific locations or markets?

---

## 🗂️ Data Source
- **Dataset:** DataCo Smart Supply Chain Dataset (Public)
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Description:**  
  The dataset simulates real-world ERP-style supply chain data and includes information on orders, shipping, products, customers, and geographic locations.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used
- **Power BI Desktop**
- **Power Query** – data cleaning and transformation
- **DAX** – KPI and measure creation
- **Supply Chain KPI Design**
- **Dashboard Storytelling & Visualization**
